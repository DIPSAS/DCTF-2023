The contest has started! Let's hear from our CTF correspondent:

```We at Team Delta are really glad that you can participate - we don't need a long introduction with lots of abbreviations and colons, let's just dive in! Team Charlie is prepared for a real dance with some of the cryptography challenges - this will not be your average tango or foxtrot. Team Romeo and Oscar are already busy with code golf, and we hear a loud echo from the Teams meeting Romeo has set up. A dash of coffee is good for inspiration - the whiskey will have to wait until the weekend. Fortunately, experienced developers from India and Lima have created good guides on YouTube on how to use CTF tools. A developer from Charlie considers giving up and asking for help from Oscar, but neither team wants to ask for a hint. We hope they figure it out, and wish you a good competition!```
