```
heiME lagDe
PanNe kaKeR
pAsTa salat
BanAn smUdi
havrE Bagel
loMpe toast
gResK saLaT
fiske GrytE
GroVe WrapS
```

Can you find the hidden flag? The flag should be submitted in the format `d:ctf{<flag>}`, e.g. `d:ctf{unforgettable-luncheon}`

Hint 1. Why are all the words the same length?

Hint 2. Why are the words capitalized like that?

Hint 3. Is there such a thing as a food-themed cipher?
