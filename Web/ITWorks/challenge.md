The admin of ITWorks has four flags scattered about. Can you find them all?

Each flag has this form: d:ctf{part-FLAG} where FLAG will be several words.
E.g: d:ctf{part-one-this-is-a-flag}

Hint 1: Is there more to a web-page than meets the eye? Where is its source?

Hint 2: One is holding a flag since it couldn't fit on his head...
