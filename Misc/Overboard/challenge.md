Ahoy there! You're the new captain of the pirate vessel Arrr-ena, and you're on the hunt for treasure.

The former captain has left you [directions to a remote island](map.txt) where they've buried a signed copy of Kernighan and Ritchie. (A pirate's first love is the C, after all.)

Unfortunately, the former captain was also a habitual micromanager, and has left very specific instructions on how to get there from your current location:

* The word `NORD` means you are to sail precisely one nautical mile north.
* The word `OEST` means you should sail one nautical mile east.
* The word `VEST` means you should sail one nautical mile west.
* The word `SOER` means you should sail one nautical mile to the south.

Your ship also has an anchor. Unfortunately, it is far too light - dropping it does nothing to slow the ship, so it will just dredge along the sea floor and leave a trail. However, the captain has left very specific instructions on what you should do with it:

* `SENK` means you should drop the anchor at once.
* `HEV` means you should pull up the anchor immediately.

Following these instructions, which words are written on the flag you spot when you arrive at the island?

Hints:
1. Why would you get instructions to raise and lower the anchor while travelling? The captain must be _plotting_ something...

2. I hope you are not trying to follow the instructions by hand! You might want to look for a "turtle graphics" toolkit - Python comes with the `turtle` package by default...
