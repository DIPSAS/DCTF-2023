After my wonderful trip in 2021, I am once again preparing for a new themed vacation.

This trip is equally baffling to my friends and even harder on my bank account, but from my travel route I think it's quite obvious what the theme is:

1. 22.182503, -75.726377
2. 62.067602, -7.277206
3. 14.168483, 145.243152
4. 42.774565, -84.590551
5. -3.445639, -79.995504
6. 35.435225, -82.537349

The flag is d:ctf{the-theme-of-my-summer-vacation-is-SECRET-THEME} with SECRET-THEME swapped out with the theme (two words) which links the destinations.

Hint 1. Hopefully you've already discovered what connects these destinations - but what uniquely identifies them?

Hint 2. What about the destinations is a regular part of the DIPS trivia contests? I hope you haven't been LAX in preparing...
