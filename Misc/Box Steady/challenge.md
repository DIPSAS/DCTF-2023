You've solved a lot of logic puzzles and brainteasers, but this one doesn't seem to make any sense at all:

KALENDER: 195
SPORT: 200
FILMER: 564
?: 580
?: 701

Can you figure out which words are missing?

The flag is `d:ctf{<missing-word-behind-580>-<missing-word-behind-701>}`, so if the word "KARAOKE" should be matched with the number 580 and "MOBILTELEFON" with 701, the flag would be `d:ctf{karaoke-mobiltelefon}`

Hint 1. You may need the help of a certain service here - a surprisingly popular one, with more users than Twitter in Norway...
