This program is a little unusual in that it can be interpreted without a CPU.

But you won't let that stop you from reverse-engineering it, will you?

Hint 1. The Linux utility `file` and CyberChef can both be used to determine the file type of arbitrary files.

Hint 2. The standard way to view this may be just as confusing in this case - you may want to look for a _roll_ mode...
